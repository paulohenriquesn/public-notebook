Cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources such as databases, storage, networking and software over the internet without running them on your own local machine or data centers.

Instead of users buying physical hardware or having the need to worry about electricity bills or maintaining them, they just rent resources over the internet using a cloud platform like AWS.
