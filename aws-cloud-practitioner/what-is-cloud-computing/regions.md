AWS maintains multiple geographic regions across the world.

AWS Regions are physical locations that have data centers.

Almost all of the regions have at least 3 availability zones with a maximum average of 6.

And what is an availability zone?

They are isolated, physically separate locations within a region with independent power, cooling and network because if something happens with one zone, another zone will be able to prevent single data center failure and avoid affecting services in that zone. 

Examples of regions with availability zones:

us-east-1
    us-east-2a
    us-east-2b
    us-east-2c
