There are three types of cloud computing:
- Public Cloud
When a third-party platform like AWS, Azure or GCP offers shared resources like servers, storage and applications over the internet operating on a pay-as-you-go basis.

- Private Cloud
A private cloud is when a company has dedicated infrastructure resources by the platform that offers more performance and avoids data leakage so the resources like computing are not shared with other customers.

- Hybrid Cloud
A hybrid cloud is when a company integrates both public and private clouds and connects with them when they need, for example a company can have their sensitive data on-premise and other data can be in the private or public cloud.
