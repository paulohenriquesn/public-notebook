IAM means Identity and Access Management.

This is the service from AWS that allows you to create users and groups and attach users to these groups.

When you create a group you can add permissions to it to give rights to users to do activities on your Amazon services.

A user can have more than 1 group, but a group can't have a group attached to it.

A user can have no group if you want to.
